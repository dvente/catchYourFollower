A simple game I made to teach myself Java. I won't be updating it, and it is presented as-is, but feel free to dig around if you want to, any feedback is always welcome. 
The game is incredibly simple. The rules are:
- if the enemy (red) touches you you lose
- the enemy can not push boxes but you can
- if the enemy can no longer move due to being surrounded by boxes or rocks you win
